# Transformer_Parameters
This project is a simple GUI python based application(.exe). It is designed using basic python libararies and some additional libararies like PyQt5; for the GUI part QT designer studio has been used.

This application takes readings of the Wattmeter, Ammeter and Voltmeter from the Open-Circuit or Short-Circuit Tests of a Transformer. It then makes the desired calculations to Provide the Output values for-
